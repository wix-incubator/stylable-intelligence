Stylable Intelligence is an extension implementing the Language Server Protocol that provides IDE support for [Stylable](https://www.stylable.io/).

Stylable Intelligence is currently only supported in VSCode (version 1.20.0 and later). Support for JetBrains IDEs (WebStorm, IntelliJ) is planned.

Currently supported: Code Completions, Diagnostics, Go to Definition, Syntax Highlighting
